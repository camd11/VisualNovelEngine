Updated Implementation Plan
Phase 1: Project Foundation & Core Systems
Goals

    Project Setup & Environment
        Initialize the React project with a bundler (Vite or Webpack).
        Create a Git repository for version control.
        Set up essential scripts (build, start, test).

    Data Structures
        Define the JSON (or YAML) schema for scenes, dialogues, and choices.
        Create a minimal “demo script” (e.g., 1–2 scenes) to confirm data loading works.

    Minimal Rendering & Navigation
        Build a basic <DialogueBox> to display text from the JSON.
        Implement a simple “next” button (or key-press) to advance through dialogues in sequence.

Deliverables

    Base Project: Folder structure, configuration files, minimal README.
    Data Schema: A small scenes.json with a few lines of dialogue.
    Initial UI: A bare-bones text display and simple navigation.

Testing & Verification

    Manual Testing: Load the dev server, confirm text displays and advances.
    (Optional) AI Smoke Test: If the AI environment is ready, have it click “next” to verify no crashes.

Phase 2: Standard VN UI & Testing Integrations
Goals

    UI Implementation
        Add a dialogue box that includes speaker names.
        Create a Quick Menu with buttons for:
            Auto (auto-advance text)
            Skip (fast-forward dialogue)
            Backlog (history of recent text)
            Save / Load / Q.Save / Q.Load (UI elements, placeholders are okay for now)
            Options (placeholder for future settings)
            Quit (return to main menu or confirm close in a browser)

    Branching & State
        Implement branching logic where choices lead to different scenes.
        Introduce a global state container (Redux/Context/Zustand) to manage flags (e.g., hasKey = true).

    Skeleton Save/Load
        Outline how saving/loading works (in-memory or basic local storage).
        Provide minimal UI for saving/loading states.

    AI-Friendly Markup
        Use stable classes/IDs or data-testid attributes for menu buttons.
        Keep layout consistent so AI can parse screenshots or locate UI elements via DOM queries.

Deliverables

    Dialogue Box + Speaker Name
    Quick Menu (auto, skip, backlog, save/load, etc.)
    Basic Branching & Global State
    Skeleton Save/Load
    DOM Consistency for AI-driven testing

Testing & Verification

    Manual: The developer can click each Quick Menu button, confirm basic functionality (or placeholders).
    AI: The AI agent can systematically click through all choices, verifying the correct scene transitions.

Phase 3: Core Features Expansion & Debug Tools
Goals

    Fully Functional Save/Load
        Multiple save slots, overwrite confirmations.
        Autosave triggers at key events (scene transitions or major choices).

    Backlog/History
        A scrollable panel or modal showing recent dialogues and speakers.
        (Optional) Replay voice lines if you plan on voice-overs.

    Debug/Dev Console
        A hidden overlay or panel for developers and testers:
            Jump to a specific scene
            Set or unset certain flags
            View logs of scene transitions or errors

    Scene Transitions & Animations
        Fade or slide transitions for scene changes.
        Basic animations for sprites or UI if needed.

Deliverables

    Save/Load System: Reliable, user-friendly UI for saving/loading.
    Backlog: A functioning dialog history screen.
    Debug Console: In-game or dev-only overlay for QA.
    Scene/Sprite Animations: Simple fade, slide, or crossfade effects.

Testing & Verification

    Manual:
        Save mid-dialogue, reload, confirm the same line is displayed.
        Open backlog, check if dialogues are correctly logged.
        Use debug console to jump around and set flags.
    AI:
        Automated tests that save, load, and confirm the correct content is displayed afterward.
        Check transitions visually or by DOM changes (depending on the AI’s capabilities).

Phase 4: Localization & Placeholder Assets
Goals

    Localization Integration
        Implement a library like react-i18next or a custom solution.
        Store text in external locale files (English, Russian, Chinese, Japanese, Korean).

    Runtime Language Switching
        Let the user select the language from the Options menu.
        Ensure text updates automatically (UI labels, dialogues).

    Placeholder-Friendliness
        Confirm that missing images (backgrounds, sprites) or audio lines show placeholders instead of crashing.
        Provide default fallback visuals (“Missing Asset” or blank) if no file is found.

    Refine AI Testing Hooks
        Validate that language changes cause predictable DOM updates.
        Keep IDs or classes consistent across languages.

Deliverables

    Multi-Language UI: Dialogue and menu text switchable at runtime.
    Placeholder Handling: Graceful fallback for missing art or audio.
    Optimized AI Environment: Clear selectors and stable layout for cross-language testing.

Testing & Verification

    Manual:
        Switch languages mid-game; check for correct translations in dialogue and menu.
        Insert a missing sprite reference, confirm that a placeholder appears.
    AI:
        Cycle through languages, verifying text changes or screenshot differences.
        Attempt to load multiple scenes with placeholders to confirm no breakage.

Phase 5: Final Polish (Voice, Art, Achievements, Gallery)
Goals

    Asset Integration
        Replace placeholder art and backgrounds with final images.
        Add voice lines or music if planned, hooking them into dialogues.

    Steam Achievements (Optional)
        If distributing on Steam, wrap with Electron or a native solution.
        Use the Steamworks SDK to tie story events/flags to achievements.

    Gallery / Extras Feature
        Implement a Gallery accessible from the main menu or an in-game “Extras” screen.
        Each CG (or music track, if applicable) is tied to a story event or flag that unlocks it.
        Show locked CGs as silhouettes or placeholders until unlocked.
        Clicking a thumbnail opens a full-size image (or plays a track).

    Advanced AI/QA Testing
        The AI tests the entire script, ensuring all achievements (if any) and all CGs can be unlocked properly.
        Validate that final art/audio assets load correctly and do not break performance.

Deliverables

    Complete Asset Pipeline: Final sprites, backgrounds, CGs, music, voice lines integrated.
    Steam Achievements (if applicable): Fully functional unlocks and notifications.
    Gallery: Functional CG/music extras menu, with locked/unlocked states.
    Thorough AI Testing: Coverage of all story routes, CG unlock conditions, achievement triggers.

Testing & Verification

    Manual:
        Developers or QA testers verify each route, unlock CGs, and check achievements.
        Confirm placeholders only remain where final assets are intentionally missing (if any).
    AI:
        Automated playthroughs that branch into all endings or flags, capturing the final CG unlock states.
        Check achievements triggers and potential performance issues with large final assets.

Phase 6: Launch & Post-Launch
Goals

    Production Build & Optimization
        Minify, bundle, and optimize images/audio for the final web release or Electron build.
        Address any performance bottlenecks (large assets, unoptimized transitions).

    Final QA & Bug Fixes
        Last round of tests for narrative consistency, UI alignment, and stable frame rates.
        Patch any leftover issues discovered during AI or manual testing.

    Release & Post-Launch Support
        Deploy the web build or publish on Steam (or both).
        Gather user feedback, fix critical post-launch bugs quickly.
        Plan for expansions or DLC if applicable.

Deliverables

    Release Candidate Build: Web or Electron (or both), ready for distribution.
    Documentation: Updated README and usage guide for adding new scenes, CGs, or translations.
    Post-Launch Strategy: If expansions or DLC are planned, outline how new content can be integrated with minimal code changes.

Testing & Verification

    Live Environment Testing:
        Confirm the final product runs smoothly in real-user scenarios.
        If using Steam, confirm achievements appear properly on user profiles.
    Post-Launch Monitoring:
        Gather analytics or feedback (optional).
        Schedule patches or updates as needed.

Summary

By following these six phases, you will:

    Establish a strong base (Phase 1) and core visual novel UI (Phase 2).
    Expand features (save/load, backlog, debug) and refine them for AI-driven testing (Phase 3).
    Add localization and ensure the engine handles placeholder assets (Phase 4).
    Perform the final polish, integrating art, voice, achievements, and a Gallery (Phase 5).
    Prepare for launch and post-launch support (Phase 6).

This structure ensures modular, testable progress at each milestone—culminating in a complete, polished visual novel engine featuring a classic UI, branching story logic, multi-language support, achievements, and a CG gallery for players to revisit unlocked content.
