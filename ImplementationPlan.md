Implementation Plan
Phase 1: Project Foundation & Core Systems
Goals

    Project Setup & Environment
        Create a new React project (using a bundler like Vite or Webpack).
        Configure package.json scripts for development and production builds.
        Initialize a Git repository for version control.

    Core Data Structures
        Define a JSON (or YAML) schema for scenes, dialogues, choices, and flags.
        Draft a small “demo script” to confirm data loading (e.g., one or two scenes, minimal branching).

    Minimal Rendering & Navigation
        Build a basic component (e.g., <DialogueBox>) to display text from the JSON data.
        Implement a “Next” button or key-press to move forward through the dialogues in sequence.

Deliverables

    React Project Skeleton: Folder structure, config files, minimal README.
    Data Schema: A simple JSON file (e.g., scenes.json) with a few demo scenes.
    Initial Scene Navigation: Ability to progress through a short sequence of lines.

Testing & Verification

    Manual Testing: Developer opens the local dev server in a browser and confirms text displays and advances.
    Basic AI Testing (Optional): If the AI environment is ready, the agent can click through the single scene to verify no crashes or errors occur.

Phase 2: Standard VN UI & State Management
Goals

    UI Implementation
        Add a dialogue box (with speaker name) at the bottom of the screen.
        Create a Quick Menu bar for the following buttons:
            Auto: Toggles auto-play of text.
            Skip: Fast-forwards dialogue (for testing, can simply jump through lines).
            Backlog: Button that opens a backlog/history of recent lines.
            Save / Load / Q.Save / Q.Load (UI elements, placeholders for now).
            Options: Placeholder button or modal for future settings.
            Quit: Return to main menu or a simple “Are you sure?” prompt in the browser.
        Ensure each UI control has stable CSS classes or data-testid attributes for AI interaction.

    Branching & State
        Implement branching logic (choices that lead to different scenes).
        Introduce a global state container (Redux, React Context, or Zustand) to manage variables/flags.

    Save/Load Framework (Skeleton)
        Outline how save data will be structured (JSON representation of current scene, flags, etc.).
        Provide minimal functionality for saving/loading from memory or local storage (does not need final UI polish yet).

Deliverables

    Dialogue Box with Speaker Name
    Quick Menu featuring auto, skip, backlog, save, load, options, and quit buttons
    Branching System: Scenes can branch based on user choices
    Global State: A store that handles flags (e.g., hasKey, relationshipPoints)
    Basic Save/Load Stubs: Possibly local storage or in-memory storage for now

Testing & Verification

    Manual Testing
        Start game in a browser, confirm that branching choices appear and lead to the correct subsequent scenes.
        Click each button in the Quick Menu (auto, skip, backlog, etc.) to confirm they work or open a placeholder.
    AI Testing
        The AI agent can systematically click through choices to confirm the correct scene transitions.
        Verify each button has consistent selectors and triggers the expected action.

Phase 3: Core Features Expansion & Debug Tools
Goals

    Full Save/Load Implementation
        Complete the UI for Save/Load.
        Allow multiple save slots, each storing scene ID, current line index, and relevant flags.
        Implement autosave at key events (scene transitions or important choices).

    Backlog/History
        A dedicated component or modal showing recent lines and speakers.
        Ability to scroll through the backlog.
        Possibly add re-voicing or re-display of text if needed (optional).

    Dev Console / Debug Overlay
        A hidden or toggleable overlay with commands:
            Jump to any scene.
            Set/unset flags manually.
            Display logs of scene transitions, error messages, etc.

    Improved Transitions & Animations
        Add simple fade or slide animations for scene changes, dialogue transitions, or sprite changes.

Deliverables

    Functional Save/Load System: UI to select a slot, confirm overwriting, load existing data.
    Backlog / Log: Working history of dialogues.
    Debug Overlay: Developer-only commands for quick testing.
    Basic Animations (fade in/out) for scene/sprite transitions.

Testing & Verification

    Manual Testing
        Save at mid-dialogue, reload, confirm the game state is restored accurately.
        Open the backlog, review recent lines, confirm they match the displayed text.
        Use debug commands to jump between scenes, observe if flags and dialogues update properly.
    AI Testing
        The AI agent can systematically test the save/load flow by saving, reloading, and verifying the correct text displays.
        The AI can open the backlog and confirm the displayed text matches recent lines.

Phase 4: Localization & Placeholder Asset Integration
Goals

    Localization System
        Introduce (or finalize) react-i18next (or a similar library).
        Store text in external resource files for English, Russian, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, etc.
        Implement runtime language switching (e.g., a dropdown in the Options menu).

    Placeholder-Friendliness
        Ensure your engine can handle missing images or voice lines gracefully (display default placeholders if unavailable).
        Confirm no crashes or UI breakage if an asset is absent.

    AI & Performance Checks
        Refine DOM structure to ensure stable selectors for AI-based visual checks.
        Optimize any slow or redundant rendering that becomes apparent with more data.

Deliverables

    Multi-language UI & dialogs: The user can switch languages, seeing all text updated.
    Robust Asset Loading: Engine does not crash if a sprite or voice line is missing; it shows a placeholder or no image.
    Performance Tweaks (if needed): Simple caching or memoization for repeated data lookups.

Testing & Verification

    Manual Testing
        Switch languages mid-game and confirm that both UI labels (e.g., “Skip”, “Backlog”) and dialog text are localized.
        Insert random missing image references in the script to ensure placeholders appear instead of causing errors.
    AI Testing
        Cycle through each language and have the AI confirm the UI text changes appropriately (the AI might parse screenshots or check DOM text).
        Check performance under multiple branches and rapid scene transitions.

Phase 5: Final Polish, Steam Achievements & Release Readiness
Goals

    Final Asset Integration
        Replace placeholder images with final character art, backgrounds, CG scenes, etc.
        Add voice lines or background music if planned, hooking into the audio system.

    Steamworks Integration (Optional)
        If releasing on Steam, wrap your build with Electron or a similar solution.
        Use the Steamworks SDK to define achievements and associate them with flags or scenes in the script.
        Add achievement notifications (in-game popups or rely on the Steam overlay).

    Advanced AI/QA Testing
        Full coverage tests: The AI agent attempts every branch or uses a “fast-forward” mode to traverse the entire script.
        Check achievements unlock at correct times, verify no missing references or script errors remain.

    Optimization & Bug Fixes
        Address any lingering layout or performance concerns.
        Remove or hide developer overlays in production if desired (or keep them accessible via debug keys).

Deliverables

    Complete Visual Novel Build: Character sprites, backgrounds, audio, final UI polish.
    Steam Achievements (if required): Achievements properly trigger and appear in users’ Steam profiles.
    Staging/Release Candidate: A stable version for final QA checks.

Testing & Verification

    Full AI Testing
        The AI agent systematically covers all routes, logs achievements, and screens for errors.
        Checks for final UI consistency (any leftover placeholder text or UI elements?).
    Manual QA & Beta
        Human testers do a thorough playthrough of all routes, focusing on narrative flow, achievement triggers, and language correctness.

Phase 6: Launch & Post-Launch Support
Goals

    Launch Preparations
        Minify and bundle the production build for web deployment.
        If going to Steam, finalize store listing, achievements, and build distribution setup.

    Post-Launch Bug Fixes & Updates
        Triage any new bugs or user requests.
        If needed, push incremental patches or small content updates.

    Planning for Expansions / DLC
        If expansions or DLC are planned, outline the data approach (new scenes, new assets) and how they integrate with the existing code.

Deliverables

    Live Production Build: A web version (hosted online) and/or an Electron build (for Steam/desktop).
    Documentation & Handover:
        Updated README on how to add or modify scenes, localize text, add new assets, or debug.
        Any post-launch roadmap or DLC planning materials.

Testing & Verification

    Live Environment Check
        Ensure the web version loads quickly, assets are properly referenced, and achievements (if applicable) function in production.
    Feedback Loop
        Gather user/AI testing feedback, fix critical issues promptly.

Summary

This full implementation plan ensures that your React-based Visual Novel Engine:

    Establishes a solid core in early phases (data-driven approach, minimal UI).
    Implements standard VN features (auto, skip, backlog, quick save/load) by Phase 2, aligning with the reference screenshot.
    Adds debugging, localization, placeholders, and essential polish in mid-phases.
    Finalizes assets and Steam achievements in the later phases, culminating in a stable release.
    Prepares for post-launch updates or expansions via a well-documented codebase and architecture.

By breaking the project into these discrete, testable phases, you guarantee clear deliverables, rapid feedback cycles, and seamless integration with AI-driven browser testing throughout development.
